# Prioritizing Development Needs: A Socio-Economic Analysis of Nations  

This project analyzes global socio-economic and health factors to identify countries most in need of aid. Using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **KMeans clustering**, we categorize nations based on healthcare, economic stability, and education metrics. The findings assist organizations like **HELP International** in resource allocation and operational planning.
